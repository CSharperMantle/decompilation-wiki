# Contributing Guide
Thank you for wanting to contribute to the Decompilation Wiki! 
Below are some simple tips to make requests for changes easier to review for the community. 

If there are ever questions on good contributions, opening issues and discussion on Discord are the best mediums for feedback.

## General Contributing Guide
To make a change, open a PR on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/mahaloz/decompilation-wiki) after [forking and making a branch](https://akrabat.com/the-beginners-guide-to-contributing-to-a-github-project/).
There are two types of changes you might make while contributing to the wiki:

1. Adding a listing to a new decompiler/tool/blog/...
2. Updating a section regarding fundamental or applied research

The best way to make PRs for these types of changes are different and found below.

### Tool Listing Change
When making changes to this area try to include three things:
1. A link to any high-level description of it (papers are ok).
2. Tags relevant to the tool (see sections like [Community Blogs](/misc/blogs))
3. Tool source link if open-source 

PRs in this category require no justification and will _very_ likely be merged after a simple review of the content. 

### Research Area Update
Changes to research areas require a little more than tool changes.
If the change is a simple typo, no justification is needed and the PR will be accepted.

However, if the change is more content-based, then it will require more explanations. 
When making changes here, it will be important to either include a citation or a well-thought-out argument against current wording/posturing.
Any links to community discussions are always appreciated, such as Reddit threads, Twitter threads, or blogs. 

Additionally, any PRs that require larger discussion will likely be tied to a Discussion post on GitHub.
