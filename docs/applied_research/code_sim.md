# Code Similarity
## Introduction
In cases such as malware identification, the ability to estimate code similarity among binaries is critical[^1].
Research in this area generally looks at ways to improve the reliability of similarity detection among binaries. 

There is little work in the direct use of decompilation for code similarity, however, the general work in the binary analysis is frequent. 
These works are included here since they often touch on or improve fundamental components in decompilation. 

The most direct research in this area has utilized Ghidra decompilation to identify inlined functions in decompilation[^2]. 

## Related Works
Many works have progressed towards binary-based code similarity that do not explicitly use decompilation [^1][^3][^4][^5][^6].
Most of these works have improved code similarity techniques indirectly by improving it for their specific uses cases. 
These uses have included malware identification[^1], duplicated bug hunting[^3][^4], and code reuse[^5].

Recent work has suggested that machine learning has made significant strides in this area[^6].
