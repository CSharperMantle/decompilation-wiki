# Program Reconstruction
When source code is unavailable for a compiled program, users may want to recover the source code so they can make edits to it and recompile it. 
In the video game scene, this is referred to as modding. 

## Video Games
A list of video games that are being reversed with a decompiler to recompile either the entire game or individual functions:

- [Halo: Combat Evolved (halo-re)](https://github.com/halo-re/halo)
