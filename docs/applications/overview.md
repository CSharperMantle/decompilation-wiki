# Decompiler Applications
Across the internet, there are many ways people have used decompilers in the wild.
In this section, you can find a collection of some of those use cases.

As an example, some decompilation uses include: 

- Program Reversing: used to understand how a program works and how to interact with it.
- [Program Reconstruction](/applications/program_reconstruction): used to completely (or partially) recompile the targetted binary
- Automated Program Repair: used for patching faulty programs
- Manual & Automated Vuln Discovery: used for finding vulnerabilities

For links to full decompilers, see the [Decompilers](/decompilers/directory) section.
