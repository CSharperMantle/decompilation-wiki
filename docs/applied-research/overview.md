# Applied Research Overview
Decompiler research that does not neatly fit into one of the [fundamental](/fundamentals/overview) areas is defined here as applied research.
Research in this area contributes to a specific use-case of decompilation that may not necessarily improve base decompilation.

As an example, most researchers would agree that variable name prediction in stripped binaries is an important research area[^1]. 
However, as it stands, variable name prediction does not improve any fundamental research area (except neural decompilation).
As such, we consider it an applied research area, with that target being human-comprehensible decompilation. 

This section is ever-growing as new research areas are explored in decompilation. 
Currently, the following areas exist:

- [Symbol Recovery](/applied-research/symbol-recovery): recovering the names or high-level symbols that are associated with a function or variable
- [Code Similarity](/applied-research/code-similarity): measuring how similar (for various uses) some binary is to another
- [Vulnerability Discovery](/applied-research/vulnerability-discovery): tuning decompilation to be better used for vulnerability discovery


## Other Research 
Some research areas don't have enough work to define a label for them.
The following works are listed here:

- Byte-exact recompilable decompilation[^4]
- Patchable decompilation[^2]
- Verifiable decompilation[^3]
- Higher abstraction support[^5][^6][^7]
